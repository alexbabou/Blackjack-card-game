# Blackjack-game
A commandline blackjack game created using ArrayLists and Collections.

## Features
- A set amount of decks using ArrayLists that will reshuffle once it empties.
- Player balance and bets to keep track of the progress.
- The ability to hit, stand, win, and draw.
- Distinction between a 1 and 11 ace card.

## Notes
I might add a running count later for counting cards.
